/* From what I am reading, chaining is when there is no spaces something like
.apple.banana is a chain
.apple .banana is a decendant combinator
very interesting lets go. */

/*
.container .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
*/

div .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Had the idea of doing div and .text I had thought it was similar to chaining, but it was more of a descendant combinator
putting the space inbetween and it works. Coloring looks alittle off and made it difficult to tell.
Ill have to get use to not looking at the color for errors. */
