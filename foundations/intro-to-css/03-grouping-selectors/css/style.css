/* OMG, I FORGOT THE . PERIOD before the class or the Unique ID. I was wondering why they werent working!
Now I know. Took me about 20 minutes trying to figure what I did wrong. While also watching anime.
button {
    color: red;
} Looking at the code below, its just adding into the class, so you dont have to keep writing the code multiple times
 */

.fontclass,
.fontclassGlamouredUp {
    font-size: 28px;
    font-family: Helvetica, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
}

.fontclass {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}

.fontclassGlamouredUp {
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
}



/* #firstelement {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
}

/* #secondelement {
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
}  I didnt group the selectors, so this time I was able to with the coding below. */

/* .fontclass#secondelement {
    background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
}

.fontclass#firstelement {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
} SO THIS WASNT WHAT WAS STATED. IT WAS UNIQUE CLASSES, NOT IDs. So I was wrong on this part...
 Sucks I went int oslutions, I will try this again. */
