/* Man, This is getting to be an information overload, Im pushing through though. 
Oh man, Earlier while adding background color, I changed one color by hovering over the code. 
When I opened the html to look at it, the html wasnt changing or anything. Had to go back and review what I was
doing that made it not visible. Found out it was the rgb adding too many colors and closing brackets or whatever
you call it and deleted it. I was able to get the site up and the colors finally popped up.
